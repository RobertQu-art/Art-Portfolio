          <h6>An arcade platformer minigame by Robert Qu and Brandon Chung</h6>
          <h6>SpLit is a collaborative project I worked on starting in late November to mid December 2021. The concept and final product was designed and created with a partner. The game was inspired by the importance of teamwork, hence the game being multiplayer and requiring its two players to collaborate in order to pass each level.</h6>

            <h6>Original Storyboard</h6>
            <h6>Our original goal was to make an interactive experience that was not only expressed through a digital interface, but also through a physcial booth and player to player communication. Thus, the storyboard and levels were designed to require precise coordination between both players. The art, controls, and overall immersion was meant to be reminiscent of classic platformers.</h6>

            <h6>Construction of the booth and interfaces</h6>
            <h6>The booth itself was a downsized immitation of an arcade machine, with two sets of controls. Each set of controls had a left and right button, as well as a jump paddle. Button inputs were connected to the computer through an arduino. The booth was designed to fit a laptop, which ran the game as well as being the display.</h6>
