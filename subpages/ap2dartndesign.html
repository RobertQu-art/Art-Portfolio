          <h6>This is a select collection of work I created during my senior year of highschool for my AP Art portfolio. Since I have always been interested in automobiles, I decided to make my portfolio around transportation design. My designs are inspired by various factors, from eras in design to those of past vehicles.</h6>

          <h5 style="font-weight:bold;padding-top:20px">BMW Concept</h5>
          <h6>Marker, Colored Pencil, 11" x 14"</h6>
          <h6>This is an original design of a concept BMW M Car, a futuristic super car that pays homage to the BMW 328.  I focused on experimental design elements such as the bubble cockpit design for the cabin, enlarged and rounded wheel arches, and an aggressive grill. I am fascinated by metallic textures and trompe l’oeil painting techniques, so I used sharp lighting to help build a metallic effect along the body and other chrome surfaces, and intense contrast to emphasize the reflective metallic surface. </h6>

          <h5 style="font-weight:bold;padding-top:20px">Acura Concept</h5>
          <h6>Marker, Colored Pencil, 11" x 14"</h6>
          <h6>I designed a sleek concept coupe that would fit into Acura’s current line up which lacks a personal luxury coupe.  My design takes from Acura’s signature style through the aggressive grill, and sharp, angular LED headlights, but also plays with a contoured fender and side, referencing classic muscle cars.  Light plays a major role in the form, with the streak of light across the grill and the dark contrasts along the sides and fenders. I have recently discovered alcohol based markers and in this illustration I focused on achieving sharp edges and layering to create darker, richer shades. </h6>

          <h6>Marker, Colored Pencil, 11" x 14"</h6>
          <h6>Sharp contrasts in color, shadow, and highlights creates metallic effect. Chrome detail emphaiszes 70s design cues, while the rounded body creates a modern and aerodynamic appearance. </h6>

          <h5 style="font-weight:bold;padding-top:20px">Sedan Concept</h5>
          <h6>Oil on Canvas, 16" x 20"</h6>
          <h6>This sedan design is my interpretation of a modern standard sedan.  I updated traditional styling by adding LED headlight strips that trail as far back as the center of the hood, wider wheel arches and bulging trim.  This was also my first oil painting and I encountered both challenges and successes using this medium.  The slow drying time if the oil paint meant I applied heavier layers to achieve desired colors and highlights.  I used the oil paints’ excellent blending properties to create smooth areas of value in the mountains and road.  I researched contemporary and vintage car advertisements as inspiration for a setting that would complement my design.</h6>
