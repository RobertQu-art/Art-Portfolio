                            She provides services to all villagers 
                            and job owners alike by buying things from them
                            and providing charity. She loves her husband, Cyrus, 
                            and often calls him "Cy-Guy." Reese will occasionally 
                            become jealous towards other girls adoring her husband.

                                <P>Cyrus is a talented builder who likes reworking furniture. 
                                    He is fairly aggressive in his speech and warns male characters 
                                    about interacting with his wife. Cyrus is also very proud of his abilities, 
                                    striking a pose when asked to rework furniture. He can be rather humorous, though.
